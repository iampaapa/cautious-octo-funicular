The Law states that the proportions of elements in a compound are always the same no matter how the compound is made.
ii. The Law of Multiple Proportions:
It states that when two elements, $A$ and $B$ combine to form more than one compound the masses of $B$ that combine with the fixed mass of $\mathrm{A}$ are in simple ratio (e.g. $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SO}_{3}, 32 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~S}$ to $32 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $32 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~S}$ to $48 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{O}$. Then for fixed mass of $\mathrm{S}$ 32; ratio of $\mathrm{O}$ is $32 \mathrm{~g}: 48 \mathrm{~g} ;$ or $2: 3)$
iii. The Law of Equivalent Proportions OR
The Law of Reciprocal Proportions OR
The Law of Permanent Ratios: It states that, if two elements A and B each form a compound with a third element $\mathrm{C}$, then the compound of $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ will contain relative proportions in which they react with C (e.g. Assume A is carbon, B is sulphur and C is hydrogen. Consider compounds $\mathrm{CH}_{4}[\mathrm{AC}]$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}[\mathrm{BC}]$, then, carbon and sulphur should combine in the ratio $\left.1: 2, \mathrm{CS}_{2},[\mathrm{AB}]\right)$",Chemistry,1,NY,NY,NY

No,,The species diversity of plants (about 22 per cent) is much less than that of animals (about 72 per cent).

They move to different habitats/ecosystem and develop species diversity,Biology,1,NY,NY,NY
No,,Explain how removal of decomposers from an ecosystem will adversely affect the functioning of the ecosystem,Decomposers break down the organic remains by secreting extracellular digestive enzymes.

No,,"A synovial joint can undergo an event called dislocation, when the bones become misaligned. However, the bones can usually be forced back into place. Why is this possible?","Synovial joints connect bones without firmly connecting their ends. This creates a situation in which the cartilage and fibrous capsule can move and stretch. When bones are dislocated, they are displaced from the proper position they rest in, and can be forced back",Biology,1,NY,NY,NY

The greater the ionic difference between the body fluid and external medium, the greater the tendency for net diffusion to low concentrations. Thus, a bony fish in a sea water is affected by the problem of losing water into the hypertonic sea water.
Surface/Volume Ratio
Generally the animal with small body size desiccates (or hydrates) more rapidly than a larger animal of the same shape.
Permeability of the Gills
Fish gills are necessarily permeable to water and solutes as they are the main site of exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the water. Active transport of salts also takes place in the gills.
Feeding
Fishes take water and solute along with the feeding. A gill takes high quantity of salt than water at the time of feeding on seashore invertebrates, these fishes, therefore, must have some special device to excrete excess of salt. However, a freshwater fish ingests large amount of water than salt and thus needs special means of salt conservation.",Biology,1,NY,NY,NY

No,,Values of the first ionisation energies for the first 20 elements (hydrogen to calcium) show several clear patterns. State any one of them and give reasons for that pattern.,"The first ionisation energy (IE) generally increases appreciably as we go across a Period.
Across a Period, the effective nuclear charge increases, and the atomic radius decreases. Hence it becomes more difficulty to remove an electron from the valence shell.
There is a gradual decrease of the first ionisation energy as we go down a Group.
Down a Group, atomic radius increases hence the attractive force of the nucleus on the outermost electrons decreases. It becomes easier to remove an electron from the valence shell.
There are minor exceptions in a Period. e.g. Be, B or $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Al}$
Relative Stability of the electron configuration becomes significant in some instances. Removing an electron to give a half- or fully-filled subshell like $B$ or $O$ respectively is more favourable despite higher effective nuclear charge and smaller atomic radius than removing an electron from half- or fully-filled sub-shell like $\mathrm{N}$ or Be.
There is a big drop in the first ionisation (IE) as we go from the end of one period to the beginning of the next period Reason: The end of a Period is occupied by an inert gas. Its atoms have fully filled shells and hence possess very stable electronic configuration and high ionisation potential. The element next after an inert gas is an element that begins a new Period and will have a valence shell of $\mathrm{ns}^{1}$.
